# TuringMachine
Project for CS154.

Group project - co-developed with Jennifer Hsiung and Farokh Confectioner.

Requirements were to use JFLAP to create a state machine that would act as a Turing machine.
Machine had to accept another Turing machine as input, as well as an input string.
The machine then had to determine whether the input string would pass or fail the input machine.
